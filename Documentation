# UAV Deconfliction System - Technical Documentation

## System Overview

### Purpose
The UAV Deconfliction System provides automated conflict detection and resolution for multiple drone missions operating in shared airspace. It evaluates both spatial proximity and temporal overlap to ensure safe mission execution.

### Key Components
1. **Mission Planning Module**
   - Handles mission creation, editing, and validation
   - Manages waypoint definitions and flight parameters

2. **Conflict Detection Engine**
   - Performs 4D (x,y,z + time) collision checks
   - Implements configurable safety buffers

3. **Environmental Model**
   - Accounts for wind speed/direction effects
   - Adjusts flight parameters dynamically

4. **Visualization Interface**
   - Interactive 3D airspace display
   - Real-time status monitoring

## Core Algorithms

### Path Generation
```python
def generate_path(waypoints, start_time, end_time):
    """
    Generates time-stamped flight path with wind adjustments
    
    Args:
        waypoints: List of (x,y,z) coordinates
        start_time: Mission start in minutes since midnight
        end_time: Mission end in minutes since midnight
    
    Returns:
        List of (x, y, z, timestamp, segment_info) points
    """
